# PhoneScraper
This is a script to take take a list of prefixes for an area code and turn them into a wordlist with all possible phone numbers. It is an updated version of the phonelist project. However, I found it to be different enough from phonelist.py that I felt it deserved it's own repository.

The current state of this project is active. I will soon be hosting all data needed to run this script against on my own site. This should allow free use of the data as well as allow wordlist generation in a more interactive way.
