# PhoneScraper
This is a script to take take a list of prefixes for an area code and turn them into a wordlist with all possible phone numbers. It is an updated version of the phonelist project. However, I found it to be different enough from phonelist.py that I felt it deserved it's own repository.

The script is now fully functional!
